- [ ] Implementing the mask of text fields data
- [ ] Error to press the button with no datas on text fields
- [ ] UnitTests!!!

______________________________
 
- [x] Implement a new Domain = Square
- [ ] Get 2 numbers from user
- [ ] Answer if it is a square or not
- [ ] Draw the UML = loading!!
- [ ] In ShapeTabbedPane class there are two quite similars methods: buildLayoutTriangle and buildLayoutSquare. In both 
methods we instantiate the panel for both shapes, but the panels are almost the same, the differences are: 
1 name of the button, 
2 answer of the result and
3 amount of text fields and labels on screen. 
Solve This problem!
